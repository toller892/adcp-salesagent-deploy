# Single Sign-On (SSO) Setup Guide

This guide walks you through configuring SSO for your tenant using OpenID Connect (OIDC). SSO is the recommended authentication method for all deployments.

## First-Time Setup

New tenants start in **Setup Mode**, which enables test credentials for initial configuration:

1. **Start the system** with `docker compose up -d`
2. **Log in** with test credentials:
   - Email: `test_super_admin@example.com`
   - Password: `test123`
3. **Configure SSO** following this guide
4. **Test your SSO login** works
5. **Disable Setup Mode** - after this, only SSO authentication works

> **Important**: Setup Mode is only for initial configuration. Always disable it once SSO is working to ensure production security.

## Overview

The AdCP Sales Agent supports any OIDC-compliant identity provider:

- **Google Workspace** - For organizations using Google
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** - For Microsoft 365 organizations
- **Okta** - Enterprise identity management
- **Auth0** - Developer-friendly identity platform
- **Keycloak** - Open-source identity server
- Any other OIDC-compliant provider

## Prerequisites

Before configuring SSO, you'll need:

1. **Admin access** to your identity provider
2. **Your tenant's redirect URI** - shown on the Users & Access page
3. **Permission** to create OAuth/OIDC applications

## Quick Start

1. Go to **Users & Access** in your tenant dashboard
2. Note your **Redirect URI** (you'll need this when creating the OAuth app)
3. Create an OAuth application in your identity provider (see provider guides below)
4. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the SSO configuration form
5. **Add yourself**: Either add your email as a user OR add your email domain to Allowed Domains
6. Click **Save Configuration**, then **Test Connection**
7. Complete the login flow - SSO is automatically enabled on success
8. Click **Disable Setup Mode** to require SSO for all logins

> **Important**: You must add yourself as a user or add your email domain BEFORE testing. Otherwise you'll see "Access denied" after authenticating with your identity provider.

## Testing Your Configuration

After entering your SSO configuration:

1. **Add yourself first**: Add your email as a user OR add your email domain to Allowed Domains
2. Click **Save Configuration**
3. Click **Test Connection** - this redirects you to your identity provider
4. Complete the login in your identity provider
5. On success, you'll see a confirmation and SSO is automatically enabled

> **Note**: SSO is automatically enabled when you successfully complete the test flow. No separate "Enable SSO" step is required.

## Transitioning to Production

Once SSO is working:

1. **Verify test logins work** - Have team members test the SSO flow (add them as users or add their domain first)
2. **Click "Disable Setup Mode"** on the Users & Access page
3. After disabling setup mode:
   - Test credentials no longer work
   - Only SSO authentication is allowed
   - You can re-enable setup mode if needed for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid redirect URI" Error

- Verify the redirect URI in your identity provider exactly matches what's shown in AdCP
- Check for trailing slashes - they must match exactly
- Ensure you're using HTTPS in production

### "Invalid client" Error

- Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
- Ensure the OAuth application is not disabled
- Verify the application type is "Web application"

### "Access denied" Error

This typically means you haven't added yourself as an authorized user:

1. **Add yourself first**: Go to Users & Access and either:
   - Add your email address under "Add User", OR
   - Add your email domain under "Allowed Domains"
2. Try the SSO test again

If you've already added yourself:
- Check that the user is authorized to access the OAuth application in your IdP
- For Azure AD: Verify the user has been assigned to the application
- For Okta: Check group assignments

### Users Not Recognized After SSO

- Ensure the identity provider returns the `email` claim
- Add the user's email to authorized domains or emails in tenant settings
- Check that the email domain matches your authorized domains

### SSO Works But Can't Disable Setup Mode

- SSO must be **enabled** before setup mode can be disabled
- SSO is automatically enabled when you successfully complete the test flow
- If SSO shows as "Not Verified", click **Test Connection** and complete the login flow

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Internal/Single-tenant** when possible to restrict to your organization
2. **Rotate client secrets** periodically (every 6-12 months)
3. **Limit scopes** to only what's needed (`openid`, `email`, `profile`)
4. **Monitor sign-in logs** in your identity provider for unusual activity
5. **Configure session timeouts** in your identity provider for security
