"""Tests for tenant-level manual approval enforcement.

This test suite ensures that the tenant's human_review_required setting
is respected during media buy creation, with the tenant setting taking
precedence over adapter-specific settings.

Issue: https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/salesagent/issues/845

## Test Strategy

This module uses two types of tests:

1. **Source Code Pattern Tests**: Verify that security-critical patterns exist in the
   implementation. These catch regressions that might accidentally remove the tenant
   approval check. If these tests fail after a refactor, update them to match the new
   pattern (or investigate if the security invariant was accidentally removed).

2. **Specification Tests**: Document the expected logical behavior. These serve as
   executable documentation of the business rules.

Integration tests for actual media buy approval flow are in:
- tests/integration_v2/test_create_media_buy_v24.py
- tests/integration/test_gam_pricing_models_integration.py
