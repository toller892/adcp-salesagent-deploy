    Bug: When incremental sync runs, it only fetches placements modified since
    the last sync. The _mark_stale_inventory function then marks ALL placements
    not touched in this sync as STALE - including unchanged ones that simply
    weren't fetched because they didn't change.

    Expected: The code should check sync_mode before calling _mark_stale_inventory
