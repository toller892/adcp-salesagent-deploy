"""
Test that local schemas extend library types when available.

This test prevents the pattern where we duplicate adcp library types
instead of extending them, which leads to type drift and bugs like
the status_filter array issue.

When a library type exists, our local schema should extend it to:
1. Inherit correct field types automatically
2. Get protocol updates when library is upgraded
3. Ensure mypy can catch type mismatches
