"""Google Cloud Platform Service Account Management.

This service handles automatic provisioning of service accounts for GAM integration.
Instead of partners sending us their service account JSON, we create the service account
for them, store it securely, and provide them the email to configure in their GAM.

Security Model - Two-Factor Control:
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Service Account Authentication Requires BOTH:                   │
    ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ 1. Private Key (we control - stored encrypted in database)     │
    │ 2. GAM User List Entry (partner controls - they add the email) │
    │                                                                 │
    │ Just knowing the service account email is NOT enough!          │
    │ API calls must be cryptographically signed with the private    │
    │ key to prove identity, AND the partner must explicitly grant   │
    │ permissions by adding the email to their GAM.                  │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Why We Store the Service Account Key:
    We need the private key (stored as gam_service_account_json) to authenticate AS the
    service account when making GAM API calls on behalf of the tenant. Without it, we
    cannot access the partner's GAM even if they've added the email to their user list.

    Flow:
    1. We create: adcp-sales-tenant123@bok-playground.iam.gserviceaccount.com + private key
    2. We store: Private key encrypted in database (using ENCRYPTION_KEY)
    3. Partner adds: Service account email to their GAM with Trafficker role
    4. When we access GAM: We use stored key to sign API requests as that service account
    5. GAM validates: "Request signed correctly AND email in my user list" → Allow access

    Partner Security:
    - Partner can revoke access anytime by removing the email from their GAM
    - Partner controls what permissions to grant (Trafficker, Salesperson, etc.)
    - Partner can restrict access to specific advertisers via GAM teams
    - Service account activity appears in partner's GAM audit logs

Authentication for This Service:
    The IAMClient uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authenticate to GCP
    for creating service accounts (not for accessing partner GAM).

    In production (Fly.io), set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON secret:
        fly secrets set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON='{"type":"service_account"...}' --app adcp-sales-agent

    The management service account must have these IAM roles in YOUR GCP project:
        - roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin (to create service accounts)
        - roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin (to create service account keys)
